This folder contains the inputs and outputs of a risk assessment process conducted against an autonomous cargo ship architecture using the FAA approach.

The autonomous ship architecture is modelled as a graph using the ORA software (http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/ora/software.php). The different modelled graphs are made available in this repository as well.
