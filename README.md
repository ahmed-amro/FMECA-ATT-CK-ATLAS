# FMECA-ATTACK-ATLAS
This repository includes information on the FMECA-ATT-CK-ATLAS (FAA) semi-automated risk assessment approach. FAA is based on the following processes and frameworks:
- FMECA: Failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis. FMECA is a widely known and practised 8-step risk assessment process outlined in the IEC 60812 standard.
- ATT&CK: MITRE ATT&CK® is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. (https://attack.mitre.org/)
- ATLAS: MITRE ATLAS™ (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) is a globally accessible, living knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world attack observations and realistic demonstrations from AI red teams and security groups. (https://atlas.mitre.org/)

In this repository, you can find the input data used for conducting the risk assessment process as well as the generated output. The risk assessment process itself is outlined in academic literature [1][2][3] but the latest code is not shared. Previous versions of the code are shared and can be accessed at (https://github.com/ahmed-amro/FMECA-ATT-CK-Evaluation/tree/main/FMECA-ATT%26CK%20Assessment)
